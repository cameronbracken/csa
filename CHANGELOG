v. 1.17, 19 October 2007
   	-- Introduced this file
	-- Corrected the advice in the help message:

	   -P nppc=<value> -- set the average number of points per cell 
	   (default = 5, increase if the point distribution is strongly
	   non-uniform to get larger cells)

	   became:

	   -P nppc=<value> -- set the average number of points per cell 
	   (default = 5, works best for uniformly distributed data. Decrease 
           to get smaller cells or increase to get larger cells)
